      <p>Outreach has an all-inclusive fee policy. The fee covers the cost of tuition, textbooks, technology 
      licenses and software, year level camps and retreats, compulsory in-class excursions, alumnae 
      membership, P&F levy, and a number of miscellaneous expenses such as class photo packs.</p>

      <p>The tuition fee does not include stationery, laptop, specialised equipment/materials, optional co-
      curricular sports and activities, co-curricular camps and tours, international and domestic exchange 
      programs or school tours, all of which are parent’s responsibility and therefore paid for separately.</p>
