        <p>How beautiful were those days </p>
        <P>When technology has not touched the world</P>
        <p>When life was simple and plain</p>
        <P>When poetry, music and art</P>
        <p>Used to inspire us to touch the sky</p>
        <p>How beautiful were those days </p>
        <p>When we used to enjoy the company of human minds and hearts</p>
        <p>Unlike the numerous appliances</p>
        <p>Which we keep close to our hearts</p>
        <p>Instead of love music and friendship</p>
        <p>The new generation would neveer know</p>
        <p>The beauty of all those precious joyous moments </p>
        <p>Which were the results of love and affection</p>
        <p>Which always come from non tech things </p>
